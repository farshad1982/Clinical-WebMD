1: i was groggy, out of it and had no idea what was happening
2: This drug has been a lifesafer for me.  I tried a lot of different drugs prior to parnate.  This is the only one that worked for more than a few months.
3: last drug en route to fight depression and with very bad results.i had already taking all of ssri and other forms.doctor suggested this one and they didnt work for me as i had very much of anger and intolerance. i stopped taking them and never tried any anti deppies.
4: It is the only anti-depressant I have tried that has given me back a good quality of life.  There are many precautions to be aware of while taking it.  I have taken this drug for 40 years.  The dose is the same now as when I began.
5: Started this generic form of Parnate because could no longer afford brand name (too expensive.  Approximately six months into taking this med I've experienced anger, great irritability (unlike me), intolerance,  no feelings of happiness which I did feel prior to taking this med.  Depression became worse and trouble sleeping at night.  Blood sugar level would increase while on this medication.  Also experienced trouble speaking. Overall not good for me.
