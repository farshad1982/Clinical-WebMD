1: I have tried them all with varying side effects, I came of off Zolft and went on to Desv and love it.  I haven't felt this close to human in years.  I do get foggy and dizzy / confused the odd time, but Ill take that over some of the other side effects I've had on others.  100mg a day.
2: I was on pristiq for approximately 2 years & it worked ok unless I didn't take it at the same time everyday, then I was lightheaded and fuzzy feeling, my eyes were blurry & had a freaking migraine. It made me scared to be on it if just a few hours of not taking it does that. Went to a new Dr & got on Effexor and I list the 15 lbs that I gained on pristiq & works just as well with out the side effects.
3: I have tried over 10 medication/ combinations since  2002 . I finally feel like myself again. I feel like I made myself antisocial for 5+ years trying different things to level my mood out , figuring out what works . To the people who have negative reviews about this medication . I take it at night time when I’m going to sleep which is usually the same time every night. . For someone who has untreatable depressive and migraine disorders. This really made a difference in my life. It took a few months to work . But years after med changes, I’m honestly happy with this one. If your psychiatrist asks you try it when nothing else works. It was worth it for me to try it. Everyone acts differently to these type of medications Read More Read Less
